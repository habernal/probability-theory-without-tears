# Probability Theory: Rigorously, Visually, Without Tears

An attempt to understand and disentagle measure theory and probability theory from scratch. Almost every node in the graph is a **definition**, with a few exceptions that clarify a concept. 

All definitions are manually rewritten from the great https://proofwiki.org/ (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License), so each node's name almost exactly corresponds to a particular page on ProofWiki.

Each edge points to a "parent" definition that the current definition builds upon. I've kept only the most meaningful edges not to clutter the picture too much.

The color clusters are just a way to visually disentangle the picture and the assignments of each node to a cluster are just an arbitrary choices.

(work in progress)

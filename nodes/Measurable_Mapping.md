## Measurable Mapping

Let $(X, \Sigma)$ and $(X', \Sigma')$ be **measurable spaces**.

A mapping $f: X \to X'$ is said to be $\Sigma/\Sigma'$-measurable if and only if:
$$
\forall E' \in \Sigma': f^{-1} [E'] \in \Sigma
$$
That is, if and only if the preimage of every measurable set under $f$ is again measurable.

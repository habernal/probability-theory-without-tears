## Continuous Random Variable

Let $(\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr)$ be a **probability space**.

Let $X$ be a **real-valued random variable** on $(\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr)$.

We say that $X$ is a continuous random variable on $(\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr)$ if and only if the **cumulative distribution function** of $X$ is continuous.

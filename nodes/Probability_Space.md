## Probability space

A probability space is a **measure space** $(\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr)$ in which $\Pr(\Omega) = 1$.

A probability space is used to define the parameters determining the outcome of an **experiment** $\mathcal{E}$.

In this context, the elements of a probability space are generally referred to as follows:

* $\Omega$ is called the sample space of $\mathcal{E}$.
* $\Sigma$ is called the event space of $\mathcal{E}$.
* $\Pr$ is called the probability measure on $\mathcal{E}$.

Thus it is a **measurable space** $(\Omega, \Sigma)$ with a probability **measure** $\Pr$.

Some sources use $\mathcal{F}$ to denote an event space.

## Event Space

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an **experiment** whose **probability space** is $(\Omega, \Sigma, \Pr)$.

The *event space* of $\mathcal{E}$ is usually denoted $\Sigma$, and is the set of all outcomes of $\mathcal{E}$ which are interesting.

By definition, $( \Omega, \Sigma )$ is a **measurable space**.

Hence the *event space* $\Sigma$ is a **sigma-algebra** on $\Omega$.

Some sources use $\mathcal{F}$ to denote an event space.

## Probability (formal definition)

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an **experiment**.

Let $A \in \Sigma$ be an **event** in the **event space** $\Sigma$ of $\mathcal{E}$.

Let $\Pr$ be the **probability measure** of $\mathcal{E}$.

Then the *probability* of $A$ is the value $\Pr(A)$.

Some sources give the probability of $A$ as $P(A)$.

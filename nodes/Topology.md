## Topology

Let $S$ be a set.

A topology on $S$ is a subset $\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}(S)$ of the **power set** of $S$ that satisfies the open set axioms:

* $\emptyset \in \tau$ and $S \in \tau$
* The union of an arbitrary subset of $\tau$ is an element of $\tau$
* The intersection of any two elements of $\tau$ is an element of $\tau$
